# ADL LRS 

#### Installation tested on Ubuntu 12.10 machine with Python 2.7.3. Should be good with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS - 13.04 releases and Python 2.7.X. This is still in the development stage and NOT ready for production

## Installation

Software Installation

    sudo apt-get install git fabric postgresql-9.1 python-setuptools postgresql-server-dev-9.1 python-dev
    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo pip install virtualenv

Setup Postgres

    sudo passwd postgres (set password for postgres system user)
    sudo -u postgres createuser -P <db_owner> (create postgres user that will be owner of the db - make superuser)
    su postgres
    psql template1
    
Create database inside of postgres shell

    CREATE DATABASE lrs OWNER <db_owner>;
    \q (exits shell)
    exit (logout as system postgres user)
    
Create ADL LRS system user

    sudo useradd -c "ADL Learning Record Store System" -m -s "/bin/bash" adllrs
    sudo passwd adllrs (set password)
    su adllrs
    cd ~
    
Create desired directory to keep LRS

    mkdir <dir_name>
    cd <dir_name>
    
Clone the LRS repository

    git clone https://github.com/adlnet/ADL_LRS.git
    cd ADL_LRS
    
Note: Under ADL_LRS/adl_lrs/settings.py, make sure the database USER and PASSWORD are the same as the db_owner created
earlier. Also, be sure to replace the current SECRET_KEY flag with a secret string of your own, and be sure not to share it.

Setup the environment

    fab setup_env
    source ../env/bin/activate 
    
Setup the LRS (creates media directories and cache tables, then syncs database)

    fab setup_lrs (when prompted make adllrs a Django superuser)

## Starting
While still in the ADL_LRS directory, run

    supervisord

To verify it's running

    supervisorctl

You should see a task named web running. This will host the application using gunicorn with 2 worker processes.
If you open a browser and visit http://localhost:8000/xapi you will hit the LRS. Gunicorn does not serve static files
so no CSS will be present. This is fine if you're doing testing/development but if you want to host a production-ready
LRS, Nginx needs to be setup to work with Gunicorn to serve static files. Please read these instructions for including
Nginx. For a more detailed description of the tools being used in general, visit this page.
