# ADL LRS

#### Installation tested on <b>Ubuntu 14.04</b> machine with Python 2.7.6, <b>Ubuntu 14.04+</b> is recommended. Updated to be compliant with the (soon to be completed) 1.0.3 xAPI spec.

This version is stable, but only intended to support a small amount of users as a proof of concept. While it uses programming best practices, it is not designed to take the place of an enterprise system.

## Installation

**Install Postgres** (The apt-get upgrade is only needed if you're running Ubuntu 14. If running 15+ you can skip to installing postgresql)

    admin:~$ wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    admin:~$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/postgresql.list'
    admin:~$ sudo apt-get update
    admin:~$ sudo apt-get upgrade

    admin:~$ sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.4 postgresql-server-dev-9.4 postgresql-contrib-9.4
    (can install 9.5 if on Ubuntu 16)

    admin:~$ sudo -u postgres createuser -P -s <db_owner_name>
    Enter password for new role: <db_owner_password>
    Enter it again: <db_owner_password>
    admin:~$ sudo -u postgres psql template1
    template1=# CREATE DATABASE lrs OWNER <db_owner_name>;
    template1=# \q (exits shell)


**Install Prerequisites**

    admin:~$ sudo apt-get install git fabric python-setuptools python-dev\
        libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
    admin:~$ sudo easy_install pip
    admin:~$ sudo pip install virtualenv

**Clone the LRS repository**

    admin:~$ cd <wherever you want to put the LRS>
    admin:~$ git clone https://github.com/adlnet/ADL_LRS.git
    admin:~$ cd ADL_LRS/

**Set the LRS configuration**


  ```
  ### File: ADL_LRS/adl_lrs/settings.py

  # configure the database
  DATABASES = {
      'default': {
          'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
          'NAME': 'lrs',
          'USER': '<db_owner_name>',
          'PASSWORD': '<db_owner_password>',
          'HOST': 'localhost',
          'PORT': '',
      }
  }

  # Make this unique, and don't share it with anybody.
  SECRET_KEY = 'Some long random string with numb3rs and $ymbol$'

  # set to 'https' if using SSL encryption - this is just for testing purposes and won't dictate if the LRS runs over http or https
  SITE_SCHEME = 'http'

  # Keep as localhost if running dev or change it to your planned domain. Should be the same in /admin site (see below) - this is just for testing purposes and won't dictate the domain or port the LRS runs on
  SITE_DOMAIN = 'localhost:8000'
  ```

**Setup the environment**

    admin:ADL_LRS$ fab setup_env
    admin:ADL_LRS$ source ../env/bin/activate
    (env)admin:ADL_LRS$


**Setup the LRS**

This creates the top level folders, <b>logs</b> and <b>media</b> at the same level as the project folder, <b>ADL_LRS</b>. Throughout the readme and the other install guides for celery and nginx you will most likely want to direct any log files to the logs directory. Inside of <b>logs</b> there are directorys for <b>celery</b>, <b>supervisord</b>, <b>uwsgi</b> and <b>nginx</b>.

    (env)admin:ADL_LRS$ fab setup_lrs
    ...
    You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have any superusers defined.
    Would you like to create one now? (yes/no): yes
    Username (leave blank to use '<system_user_name>'):
    E-mail address:
    Password: <this can be different than your system password since this will just be for the LRS site>
    Password (again):
    Superuser created successfully.
  ...

If you get some sort of authentication error here, make sure that Django and PostgreSQL are both
using the same form of authentication (*adl_lrs/settings.py* and *pg_hba.conf*) and that the credentials
given in *settings.py* are the same as those you created.

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> You <b>MUST</b> setup celery for retrieving the activity metadata from the ID as well as voiding statements that might have come in out of order. Visit the [Using Celery](https://github.com/adlnet/ADL_LRS/wiki/Using-Celery) wiki page for installation instructions.

## Starting

While still in the ADL_LRS directory, run

    (env)dbowner:ADL_LRS$ ./manage.py runserver

This starts a lightweight development web server on the local machine. By default, the server runs on port 8000 on the IP address 127.0.0.1. You can pass in an IP address and port number explicitly. This will serve your static files without setting up Nginx but must NOT be used for production purposes. Press `CTRL + C` to stop the server


Set your site domain

  Visit the admin section of your website (/admin). Click Sites and you'll see the only entry is 'example.com' (The key for this in the DB is 1 and it maps back to the SITE_ID value in settings). Change the domain and name to the domain you're going to use. This should be the same value as what you set SITE_DOMAIN as in the settings.py file. If running locally it could be localhost:8000, or if production could be lrs.adlnet.gov (DON'T include the scheme here, that should be set in settings.py already). Once again this does not change the domain it's running on...you want to set that up first then change this value to your domain name.

Whenever you want to exit the virtual environment, just type `deactivate`

For other ways to start and run the LRS, please visit our Wiki.
